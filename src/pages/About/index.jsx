					<div className="history">
						<p>
							Probably my first line of code was ‚Äúshutdown -t 30 -s -f‚Äù in a .bat file, to send to my friends on MSN and see them go offline.
						</p>

						<p>
							After that, I found a PHP script that sent form data via email, so I developed an orkut phishing page that I saved as favorite on the school library computers.
						</p>

						<p>
							When I entered high school, I helped my father maintain his company's website, which used a CMS called Modx, but always putting pieces of code together, not understanding what was going on.
						</p>

						<p>
							When I graduated from the technical school in computer science, I chose to go to digital design college, because in addition to development, I learned to enjoy motion while in high school, and realized that I had more difficulty learning animation alone than making codes work.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the first year of college, I got an internship in the development area at J√ºssi, whose main task was to develop email marketing.
						</p>

						<p>
							When I was hired, I started working with Vtex store maintenance, Wordpress blog development and landing page creation.
						</p>

						<p>
							Currently I work as a developer at J√ºssi, taking care of some stores in Vtex IO with React.js.
